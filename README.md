# discogs-roulette
A website for querying Discogs collections and selecting something random to listen to.

## Purpose
This is a simple project to make deciding what to listen to easier. I found myself staring at my physical media collection and struggling to pick something to listen to -- often I would listen to the same discs or records over and over while forgetting about many other great albums I own. Luckily, I've already cataloged my media collection via Discogs, so to eliminate choice paralysis, I've decided to create a website which will query the specified user's Discogs collection and return a random album to play. 

## Core Features
- Access a specified Discogs user's collection via API
- Return a random album from the collection

## Planned Features
- Results filtering (genre, media type, artist, etc.)
- Collection updates such as album rating, etc. via OAuth or similar
- Login system (likely via Google, Facebook, Apple login)
- Playback history per user
- Social interaction (see friend's playback history, query friend collections, etc.)
- Social media integration
